    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>

    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

    <p>
      Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of
      Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will
      answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>

    <p>
      We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
      however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a
      semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
      <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
      <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please let me know which start date you prefer.</p>

    <p>
      You can find more information about important university dates on our
      <a href="#">website</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

    <p>
      At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research
      facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science
      and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and
      just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the
      ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by the following, in order of
      priority:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
        (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)
      </li>
      <li>
        Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures
        exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases
        (effect of 3 × 10³ increasing to 3 × 10⁴)
      </li>
      <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      So please provide more information on each of these subjects, including
      how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other
      resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know.
    </p>

    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

    <p>
      Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic
      tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as
      follows:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Polynesian chicken dance</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300 BC,
        where a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens to
        encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
      </dd>

      <dt><strong>Icelandic brownian shuffle</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they
        used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together on
        the floor and shuffling their bodies around in tiny rapid movements.
        Some say this inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
      </dd>

      <dt><strong>Arctic robot dance</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        English explorers in the 1960s believed they had discovered a new dance
        style characterized by robotic, stilted movements practiced by Northern
        Alaskans. Later it was revealed they were just really cold.
      </dd>
